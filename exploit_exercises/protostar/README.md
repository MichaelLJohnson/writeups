--------------------

The purpose of this directory and its sub-directories is to contain any information regarding levels released by the [Exploit Exercises] online practice wargames under the wargame [Protostar].

The hope with this repository and this specific directory is that users will have a place to post resources, scripts, solution writeups, and any other material that may relate to solving some challenges. If a problem does not have some of your input, whether or not it some code or even a full-blown writeup and solution, feel free to add something!

> Protostar introduces the following in a friendly way:
>
> * Network programming
> * Byte order
> * Handling sockets
> * Stack overflows
> * Format strings
> * Heap overflows
>
> The above is introduced in a simple way, starting with simple memory corruption and modification, function redirection, and finally executing custom shellcode.
> 
> In order to make this as easy as possible to introduce Address Space Layout Randomisation and Non-Executable memory has been disabled. If you are interested in covering ASLR and NX memory, please see the Fusion page.

> Getting started
> ==============
> 
> Once the virtual machine has booted, you are able to log in as the “user” account with the password “user” (without the quotes).
> 
> The levels to be exploited can be found in the /opt/protostar/bin directory.
> 
> For debugging the final levels, you can log in as root with password “godmode” (without the quotes)
>
> Some levels can be done purely remotely.
