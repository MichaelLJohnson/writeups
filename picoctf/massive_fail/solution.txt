Check out the /app/controllers/user_controller.rb and the /db/schema.rb
file

the schema.db file shows you the fields for the user object
you can see one called `is_admin` 

the `user_controller.rb` explains that in the user creation post form
it creates the properties based off of all the variables passed to it

if you use Tamper Data or burpsuite you can see that it passes fields
like user[password] or user[username]

so you can add an element to the POST request

like


user[is_admin]  =   1

and then you get the flag. :)
